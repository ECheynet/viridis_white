# viridis_white: a modified viridis colormap


## Summary
The viridis_white colormap is a modification of the Viridis colormap that was introduced in Matplotlib in 2015. In viridis_white, the yellowish sequence is replaced by a white sequence. It allows some additional flexibility when it comes to using a colormap on a white background. Note: The viridis_white colormap may exist for Matplotlib too. I saw it some years ago but could not find the webpage anymore. If you find it, please notify me so I can add it in the acknowledgments.
